In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force, of the people. The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war, and in the degeneracy of manners and of morals engendered by both.

Licensing cannot be required of free people, because taking on the restrictions of a license requires the surrender of a right. The driver's license can be required of people who use the highways for trade, commerce, or hire; that is, if they earn their living on the road, and if they use extraordinary machines on the roads. If you are not using the highways for profit, you cannot be required to have a driver's license. \n\nBRIEF IN SUPPORT OF NOTICE FOR DISMISSAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION\n\nNOW, comes the Accused, appearing specially and not generally or voluntarily, but under threat of arrest if he failed to do so, with this \"BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF NOTICE FOR DISMISSAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION,\" stating as follows:\n\nARGUMENT\n\nIf ever a judge understood the public's right to use the public roads, it was Justice Tolman of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington. Justice Tolman stated:\n\n\"Complete freedom of the highways is so old and well established a blessing that we have forgotten the days of the Robber Barons and toll roads, and yet, under an act like this, arbitrarily administered, the highways may be completely monopolized, if, through lack of interest, the people submit, then they may look to see the most sacred of their liberties taken from them one by one, by more or less rapid encroachment.\"\nRobertson vs. Department of Public Works, 180 Wash 133, 147.\n\nThe words of Justice Tolman ring most prophetically in the ears of Citizens throughout the country today as the use of the public roads has been monopolized by the very entity which has been empowered to stand guard over our freedoms, i.e., that of state government.\n\nRIGHTS\n\nThe \"most sacred of liberties\" of which Justice Tolman spoke was personal liberty. The definition of personal liberty is:\n\n\"Personal liberty, or the Right to enjoyment of life and liberty, is one of the fundamental or natural Rights, which has been protected by its inclusion as a guarantee in the various constitutions, which is not derived from, or dependent on, the U.S. Constitution, which may not be submitted to a vote and may not depend on the outcome of an election. It is one of the most sacred and valuable Rights, as sacred as the Right to private property ... and is regarded as inalienable.\"\n16 C.J.S., Constitutional Law, Sect.202, p.987\n\nThis concept is further amplified by the definition of personal liberty:\n\n\"Personal liberty largely consists of the Right of locomotion -- to go where and when one pleases -- only so far restrained as the Rights of others may make it necessary for the welfare of all other citizens. The Right of the Citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, by horse drawn carriage, wagon, or automobile, is not a mere privilege which may be permitted or prohibited at will, but the common Right which he has under his Right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Under this Constitutional guarantee one may, therefore, under normal conditions, travel at his inclination along the public highways or in public places, and while conducting himself in an orderly and decent manner, neither interfering with nor disturbing another's Rights, he will be protected, not only in his person, but in his safe conduct.\"\nII Am.Jur. (1st) Constitutional Law, Sect.329, p.1135\n\nand further ...\n\n\"Personal liberty -- consists of the power of locomotion, of changing situations, of removing one's person to whatever place one's inclination may direct, without imprisonment or restraint unless by due process of law.\"\nBovier's Law Dictionary, 1914 ed., Black's Law Dictionary, 5th ed.; \nBlackstone's Commentary 134; \nHare, Constitution, Pg. 777\n\nJustice Tolman was concerned about the State prohibiting the Citizen from the \"most sacred of his liberties,\" the Right of movement, the Right of moving one's self from place to place without threat of imprisonment, the Right to use the public roads in the ordinary course of life.\n\nWhen the State allows the formation of a corporation it may control its creation by establishing guidelines (statutes) for its operation (charters). Corporations who use the roads in the course of business do not use the roads in the ordinary course of life. There is a difference between a corporation and an individual. The United States Supreme Court has stated:\n\n\"...We are of the opinion that there is a clear distinction in this particular between an individual and a corporation, and that the latter has no right to refuse to submit its books and papers for examination on the suit of the State. The individual may stand upon his Constitutional Rights as a Citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no duty to the State or to his neighbors to divulge his business, or to open his doors to investigation, so far as it may tend to incriminate him. He owes no such duty to the State, since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of his life, liberty, and property. His Rights are such as the law of the land long antecedent to the organization of the state, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his Rights are the refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure except under warrant of law. He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights.\"\n\"Upon the other hand, the corporation is a creature of the state. It is presumed to be incorporated for the benefit of the public. It receives certain special privileges and franchises, and holds them subject to the laws of the state and the limitations of its charter. Its rights to act as a corporation are only preserved to it so long as it obeys the laws of its creation. There is a reserved right in the legislature to investigate its contracts and find out whether it has exceeded its powers. It would be a strange anomaly to hold that the State, having chartered a corporation to make use of certain franchises, could not in exercise of its sovereignty inquire how those franchises had been employed, and whether they had been abused, and demand the production of corporate books and papers for that purpose.\"\nHale vs. Hinkel, 201 US 43, 74-75\n\nCorporations engaged in mercantile equity fall under the purview of the State's admiralty jurisdiction, and the public at large must be protected from their activities, as they (the corporations) are engaged in business for profit.\n\n\"...Based upon the fundamental ground that the sovereign state has the plenary control of the streets and highways in the exercise of its police power (see police power, infra.), may absolutely prohibit the use of the streets as a place for the prosecution of a private business for gain. They all recognize the fundamental distinction between the ordinary Right of the Citizen to use the streets in the usual way and the use of the streets as a place of business or a main instrumentality of business for private gain. The former is a common Right, the latter is an extraordinary use. As to the former, the legislative power is confined to regulation, as to the latter, it is plenary and extends even to absolute prohibition. Since the use of the streets by a common carrier in the prosecution of its business as such is not a right but a mere license of privilege.\"\nHadfield vs. Lundin, 98 Wash 516\n\nIt will be necessary to review early cases and legal authority in order to reach a lawfully correct theory dealing with this Right or \"privilege.\" We will attempt to reach a sound conclusion as to what is a \"Right to use the road\" and what is a \"privilege to use the road\". Once reaching this determination, we shall then apply those positions to modern case decision.\n\n\"Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.\"\nMiranda vs. Arizona, 384 US 436, 491\n\nand ...\n\n\"The claim and exercise of a constitutional Right cannot be converted into a crime.\"\nMiller vs. U.S., 230 F. 486, 489\n\nand ...\n\n\"There can be no sanction or penalty imposed upon one because of this exercise of constitutional Rights.\"\nSnerer vs. Cullen, 481 F. 946\n\nStreets and highways are established and maintained for the purpose of travel and transportation by the public. Such travel may be for business or pleasure.\n\n\"The use of the highways for the purpose of travel and transportation is not a mere privilege, but a common and fundamental Right of which the public and the individual cannot be rightfully deprived.\"\nChicago Motor Coach vs. Chicago, 169 NE 22?1; \nLigare vs. Chicago, 28 NE 934; \nBoon vs. Clark, 214 SSW 607; \n25 Am.Jur. (1st) Highways Sect.163\n\nand ...\n\n\"The Right of the Citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, either by horse drawn carriage or by automobile, is not a mere privilege which a city can prohibit or permit at will, but a common Right which he has under the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\nThompson vs. Smith, 154 SE 579\n\nSo we can see that a Citizen has a Right to travel upon the public highways by automobile and the Citizen cannot be rightfully deprived of his Liberty. So where does the misconception that the use of the public road is always and only a privilege come from?\n\n\"... For while a Citizen has the Right to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, that Right does not extend to the use of the highways, either in whole or in part, as a place for private gain. For the latter purpose, no person has a vested right to use the highways of the state, but is a privilege or a license which the legislature may grant or withhold at its discretion.\"\nState vs. Johnson, 243 P. 1073; \nCummins vs. Homes, 155 P. 171; \nPackard vs. Banton, 44 S.Ct. 256; \nHadfield vs. Lundin, 98 Wash 516\n\nHere the court held that a Citizen has the Right to travel upon the public highways, but that he did not have the right to conduct business upon the highways. On this point of law all authorities are unanimous.\n\n\"Heretofore the court has held, and we think correctly, that while a Citizen has the Right to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, that Right does not extend to the use of the highways, either in whole or in part, as a place of business for private gain.\"\nWillis vs. Buck, 263 P. l 982; \nBarney vs. Board of Railroad Commissioners, 17 P.2d 82\n\nand ...\n\n\"The right of the citizen to travel upon the highway and to transport his property thereon, in the ordinary course of life and business, differs radically and obviously from that of one who makes the highway his place of business for private gain in the running of a stagecoach or omnibus.\"\nState vs. City of Spokane, 186 P. 864\n\nWhat is this Right of the Citizen which differs so \"radically and obviously\" from one who uses the highway as a place of business? Who better to enlighten us than Justice Tolman of the Supreme Court of Washington State? In State vs. City of Spokane, supra, the Court also noted a very \"radical and obvious\" difference, but went on to explain just what the difference is:\n\n\"The former is the usual and ordinary right of the Citizen, a common right to all, while the latter is special, unusual, and extraordinary.\"\nand ...\n\n\"This distinction, elementary and fundamental in character, is recognized by all the authorities.\"\nState vs. City of Spokane, supra.\n\nThis position does not hang precariously upon only a few cases, but has been proclaimed by an impressive array of cases ranging from the state courts to the federal courts.\n\n\"the right of the Citizen to travel upon the highway and to transport his property thereon in the ordinary course of life and business, differs radically and obviously from that of one who makes the highway his place of business and uses it for private gain in the running of a stagecoach or omnibus. The former is the usual and ordinary right of the Citizen, a right common to all, while the latter is special, unusual, and extraordinary.\"\nEx Parte Dickey, (Dickey vs. Davis), 85 SE 781\n\nand ...\n\n\"The right of the Citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, in the ordinary course of life and business, is a common right which he has under the right to enjoy life and liberty, to acquire and possess property, and to pursue happiness and safety. It includes the right, in so doing, to use the ordinary and usual conveyances of the day, and under the existing modes of travel, includes the right to drive a horse drawn carriage or wagon thereon or to operate an automobile thereon, for the usual and ordinary purpose of life and business.\"\nThompson vs. Smith, supra.; \nTeche Lines vs. Danforth, Miss., 12 S.2d 784\n\nThere is no dissent among various authorities as to this position. (See Am. Jur. [1st] Const. Law, 329 and corresponding Am. Jur. [2nd].)\n\n\"Personal liberty -- or the right to enjoyment of life and liberty -- is one of the fundamental or natural rights, which has been protected by its inclusion as a guarantee in the various constitutions, which is not derived from nor dependent on the U.S. Constitution. ... It is one of the most sacred and valuable rights [remember the words of Justice Tolman, supra.] as sacred as the right to private property ... and is regarded as inalienable.\"\n16 C.J.S. Const. Law, Sect.202, Pg. 987\n\nAs we can see, the distinction between a \"Right\" to use the public roads and a \"privilege\" to use the public roads is drawn upon the line of \"using the road as a place of business\" and the various state courts have held so. But what have the U.S. Courts held on this point?\n\n\"First, it is well established law that the highways of the state are public property, and their primary and preferred use is for private purposes, and that their use for purposes of gain is special and extraordinary which, generally at least, the legislature may prohibit or condition as it sees fit.\"\nStephenson vs. Rinford, 287 US 251; \nPachard vs Banton, 264 US 140, and cases cited; \nFrost and F. Trucking Co. vs. Railroad Commission, 271 US 592; \nRailroad commission vs. Inter-City Forwarding Co., 57 SW.2d 290; \nParlett Cooperative vs. Tidewater Lines, 164 A. 313\n\nSo what is a privilege to use the roads? By now it should be apparent even to the \"learned\" that an attempt to use the road as a place of business is a privilege. The distinction must be drawn between ...\n\nTravelling upon and transporting one's property upon the public roads, which is our Right; and ...\nUsing the public roads as a place of business or a main instrumentality of business, which is a privilege.\n\"[The roads] ... are constructed and maintained at public expense, and no person therefore, can insist that he has, or may acquire, a vested right to their use in carrying on a commercial business.\"\nEx Parte Sterling, 53 SW.2d 294; \nBarney vs. Railroad Commissioners, 17 P.2d 82; \nStephenson vs. Binford, supra.\n\n\"When the public highways are made the place of business the state has a right to regulate their use in the interest of safety and convenience of the public as well as the preservation of the highways.\"\nThompson vs. Smith, supra.\n\n\"[The state's] right to regulate such use is based upon the nature of the business and the use of the highways in connection therewith.\"\nIbid.\n\n\"We know of no inherent right in one to use the highways for commercial purposes. The highways are primarily for the use of the public, and in the interest of the public, the state may prohibit or regulate ... the use of the highways for gain.\"\nRobertson vs. Dept. of Public Works, supra.\n\nThere should be considerable authority on a subject as important a this deprivation of the liberty of the individual \"using the roads in the ordinary course of life and business.\" However, it should be noted that extensive research has not turned up one case or authority acknowledging the state's power to convert the individual's right to travel upon the public roads into a \"privilege.\"\n\nTherefore, it is concluded that the Citizen does have a \"Right\" to travel and transport his property upon the public highways and roads and the exercise of this Right is not a \"privilege.\"\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nIn order to understand the correct application of the statute in question, we must first define the terms used in connection with this point of law. As will be shown, many terms used today do not, in their legal context, mean what we assume they mean, thus resulting in the misapplication of statutes in the instant case.\n\nAUTOMOBILE AND MOTOR VEHICLE\n\nThere is a clear distinction between an automobile and a motor vehicle. An automobile has been defined as:\n\n\"The word `automobile' connotes a pleasure vehicle designed for the transportation of persons on highways.\"\nAmerican Mutual Liability Ins. Co., vs. Chaput, 60 A.2d 118, 120; 95 NH 200\n\nWhile the distinction is made clear between the two as the courts have stated:\n\n\"A motor vehicle or automobile for hire is a motor vehicle, other than an automobile stage, used for the transportation of persons for which remuneration is received.\"\nInternational Motor Transit Co. vs. Seattle, 251 P. 120\n\nThe term `motor vehicle' is different and broader than the word `automobile.'\"\nCity of Dayton vs. DeBrosse, 23 NE.2d 647, 650; 62 Ohio App. 232\n\nThe distinction is made very clear in Title 18 USC 31:\n\n\"Motor vehicle\" means every description or other contrivance propelled or drawn by mechanical power and used for commercial purposes on the highways in the transportation of passengers, or passengers and property.\n\"Used for commercial purposes\" means the carriage of persons or property for any fare, fee, rate, charge or other considerations, or directly or indirectly in connection with any business, or other undertaking intended for profit.\nClearly, an automobile is private property in use for private purposes, while a motor vehicle is a machine which may be used upon the highways for trade, commerce, or hire.\n\nTRAVEL\n\nThe term \"travel\" is a significant term and is defined as:\n\"The term `travel' and `traveler' are usually construed in their broad and general sense ... so as to include all those who rightfully use the highways viatically (when being reimbursed for expenses) and who have occasion to pass over them for the purpose of business, convenience, or pleasure.\"\n25 Am.Jur. (1st) Highways, Sect.427, Pg. 717\n\n\"Traveler -- One who passes from place to place, whether for pleasure, instruction, business, or health.\"\nLocket vs. State, 47 Ala. 45; \nBovier's Law Dictionary, 1914 ed., Pg. 3309\n\n\"Travel -- To journey or to pass through or over; as a country district, road, etc. To go from one place to another, whether on foot, or horseback, or in any conveyance as a train, an automobile, carriage, ship, or aircraft; Make a journey.\"\nCentury Dictionary, Pg. 2034\n\nTherefore, the term \"travel\" or \"traveler\" refers to one who uses a conveyance to go from one place to another, and included all those who use the highways as a matter of Right.\n\nNotice that in all these definitions, the phrase \"for hire\" never occurs. This term \"travel\" or \"traveler\" implies, by definition, one who uses the road as a means to move from one place to another.\n\nTherefore, one who uses the road in the ordinary course of life and business for the purpose of travel and transportation is a traveler.\n\nDRIVER\n\nThe term \"driver\" in contradistinction to \"traveler,\" is defined as:\n\n\"Driver -- One employed in conducting a coach, carriage, wagon, or other vehicle ...\"\nBovier's Law Dictionary, 1914 ed., Pg. 940\n\nNotice that this definition includes one who is \"employed\" in conducting a vehicle. It should be self-evident that this individual could not be \"travelling\" on a journey, but is using the road as a place of business.\n\nOPERATOR\n\nToday we assume that a \"traveler\" is a \"driver,\" and a \"driver\" is an \"operator.\" However, this is not the case.\n\n\"It will be observed from the language of the ordinance that a distinction is to be drawn between the terms `operator' and `driver'; the `operator' of the service car being the person who is licensed to have the car on the streets in the business of carrying passengers for hire; while the `driver' is the one who actually drives the car. However, in the actual prosecution of business, it was possible for the same person to be both \"operator\" and \"driver.\"\nNewbill vs. Union Indemnity Co., 60 SE.2d 658\n\nTo further clarify the definition of an \"operator\" the court observed that this was a vehicle \"for hire\" and that it was in the business of carrying passengers.\n\nThis definition would seem to describe a person who is using the road as a place of business, or in other words, a person engaged in the \"privilege\" of using the road for gain.\n\nThis definition, then, is a further clarification of the distinction mentioned earlier, and therefore:\n\nTravelling upon and transporting one's property upon the public roads as a matter of Right meets the definition of a traveler.\nUsing the road as a place of business as a matter of privilege meets the definition of a driver or an operator or both.\nTRAFFIC\n\nHaving defined the terms \"automobile,\" \"motor vehicle,\" \"traveler,\" \"driver,\" and \"operator,\" the next term to define is \"traffic\":\n\n\"... Traffic thereon is to some extent destructive, therefore, the prevention of unnecessary duplication of auto transportation service will lengthen the life of the highways or reduce the cost of maintenance, the revenue derived by the state ... will also tend toward the public welfare by producing at the expense of those operating for private gain, some small part of the cost of repairing the wear ...\"\nNorthern Pacific R.R. Co. vs. Schoenfeldt, 213 P. 26\n\nNote: In the above, Justice Tolman expounded upon the key of raising revenue by taxing the \"privilege\" to use the public roads \"at the expense of those operating for gain.\"\n\nIn this case, the word \"traffic\" is used in conjunction with the unnecessary Auto Transportation Service, or in other words, \"vehicles for hire.\" The word \"traffic\" is another word which is to be strictly construed to the conducting of business.\n\n\"Traffic -- Commerce, trade, sale or exchange of merchandise, bills, money, or the like. The passing of goods and commodities from one person to another for an equivalent in goods or money ...\"\nBovier's Law Dictionary, 1914 ed., Pg. 3307\n\nHere again, notice that this definition refers to one \"conducting business.\" No mention is made of one who is traveling in his automobile. This definition is of one who is engaged in the passing of a commodity or goods in exchange for money, i.e .., vehicles for hire.\n\nFurthermore, the words \"traffic\" and \"travel\" must have different meanings which the courts recognize. The difference is recognized in Ex Parte Dickey, supra:\n\n\"...in addition to this, cabs, hackney coaches, omnibuses, taxicabs, and hacks, when unnecessarily numerous, interfere with the ordinary traffic and travel and obstruct them.\"\nThe court, by using both terms, signified its recognition of a distinction between the two. But, what was the distinction? We have already defined both terms, but to clear up any doubt:\n\n\"The word `traffic' is manifestly used here in secondary sense, and has reference to the business of transportation rather than to its primary meaning of interchange of commodities.\"\nAllen vs. City of Bellingham, 163 P. 18\n\nHere the Supreme Court of the State of Washington has defined the word \"traffic\" (in either its primary or secondary sense) in reference to business, and not to mere travel! So it is clear that the term \"traffic\" is business related and therefore, it is a \"privilege.\" The net result being that \"traffic\" is brought under the (police) power of the legislature. The term has no application to one who is not using the roads as a place of business.\n\nLICENSE\n\nIt seems only proper to define the word \"license,\" as the definition of this word will be extremely important in understanding the statutes as they are properly applied:\n\n\"The permission, by competent authority to do an act which without permission, would be illegal, a trespass, or a tort.\"\nPeople vs. Henderson, 218 NW.2d 2, 4\n\n\"Leave to do a thing which licensor could prevent.\"\nWestern Electric Co. vs. Pacent Reproducer Corp., 42 F.2d 116, 118\n\nIn order for these two definitions to apply in this case, the state would have to take up the position that the exercise of a Constitutional Right to use the public roads in the ordinary course of life and business is illegal, a trespass, or a tort, which the state could then regulate or prevent.\n\nThis position, however, would raise magnitudinous Constitutional questions as this position would be diametrically opposed to fundamental Constitutional Law. (See \"Conversion of a Right to a Crime,\" infra.)\n\nIn the instant case, the proper definition of a \"license\" is:\n\n\"a permit, granted by an appropriate governmental body, generally for consideration, to a person, firm, or corporation, to pursue some occupation or to carry on some business which is subject to regulation under the police power.\"\nRosenblatt vs. California State Board of Pharmacy, 158 P.2d 199, 203\n\nThis definition would fall more in line with the \"privilege\" of carrying on business on the streets.\n\nMost people tend to think that \"licensing\" is imposed by the state for the purpose of raising revenue, yet there may well be more subtle reasons contemplated; for when one seeks permission from someone to do something he invokes the jurisdiction of the licensor which, in this case, is the state. In essence, the licensee may well be seeking to be regulated by the licensor.\n\n\"A license fee is a charge made primarily for regulation, with the fee to cover costs and expenses of supervision or regulation.\"\nState vs. Jackson, 60 Wisc.2d 700; 211 NW.2d 480, 487\n\nThe fee is the price; the regulation or control of the licensee is the real aim of the legislation.\n\nAre these licenses really used to fund legitimate government, or are they nothing more than a subtle introduction of police power into every facet of our lives? Have our \"enforcement agencies\" been diverted from crime prevention, perhaps through no fault of their own, instead now busying themselves as they \"check\" our papers to see that all are properly endorsed by the state?\n\nHow much longer will it be before we are forced to get a license for our lawn mowers, or before our wives will need a license for her blender or mixer? They all have motors on them and the state can always use the revenue.\n\nPOLICE POWER\n\nThe confusion of the police power with the power of taxation usually arises in cases where the police power has affixed a penalty to a certain act, or where it requires licenses to be obtained and a certain sum be paid for certain occupations. The power used in the instant case cannot, however, be the power of taxation since an attempt to levy a tax upon a Right would be open to Constitutional objection. (See \"taxing power,\" infra.)\n\nEach law relating to the use of police power must ask three questions:\n\n\"Is there threatened danger?\nDoes a regulation involve a Constitutional Right?\nIs this regulation reasonable?\"\nPeople vs. Smith, 108 Am.St.Rep. 715; \nBovier's Law Dictionary, 1914 ed., under \"Police Power\"\n\nWhen applying these three questions to the statute in question, some very important issues emerge.\n\nFirst, \"is there a threatened danger\" in the individual using his automobile on the public highways, in the ordinary course of life and business?\n\nThe answer is No! There is nothing inherently dangerous in the use of an automobile when it is carefully managed. Their guidance, speed, and noise are subject to a quick and easy control, under a competent and considerate manager, it is as harmless on the road as a horse and buggy.\n\nIt is the manner of managing the automobile, and that alone, which threatens the safety of the public. The ability to stop quickly and to respond quickly to guidance would seem to make the automobile one of the least dangerous conveyances. (See Yale Law Journal, December, 1905.)\n\n\"The automobile is not inherently dangerous.\"\nCohens vs. Meadow, 89 SE 876; \nBlair vs. Broadmore, 93 SE 532\n\nTo deprive all persons of the Right to use the road in the ordinary course of life and business, because one might, in the future, become dangerous, would be a deprivation not only of the Right to travel, but also the Right to due process. (See \"Due Process,\" infra.)\n\nNext; does the regulation involve a Constitutional Right?\n\nThis question has already been addressed and answered in this brief, and need not be reinforced other than to remind this Court that this Citizen does have the Right to travel upon the public highway by automobile in the ordinary course of life and business. It can therefore be concluded that this regulation does involve a Constitutional Right.\n\nThe third question is the most important in this case. \"Is this regulation reasonable?\"\n\nThe answer is No! It will be shown later in \"Regulation,\" infra., that this licensing statute is oppressive and could be effectively administered by less oppressive means.\n\nAlthough the Fourteenth Amendment does not interfere with the proper exercise of the police power, in accordance with the general principle that the power must be exercised so as not to invade unreasonably the rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution, it is established beyond question that every state power, including the police power, is limited by the Fourteenth Amendment (and others) and by the inhibitions there imposed.\n\nMoreover, the ultimate test of the propriety of police power regulations must be found in the Fourteenth Amendment, since it operates to limit the field of the police power to the extent of preventing the enforcement of statutes in denial of Rights that the Amendment protects. (See Parks vs. State, 64 NE 682.)\n\n\"With regard particularly to the U.S. Constitution, it is elementary that a Right secured or protected by that document cannot be overthrown or impaired by any state police authority.\"\nConnolly vs. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 US 540; \nLafarier vs. Grand Trunk R.R. Co., 24 A. 848; \nO'Neil vs. Providence Amusement Co., 108 A. 887\n\n\"The police power of the state must be exercised in subordination to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution.\"\nBacahanan vs. Wanley, 245 US 60; \nPanhandle Eastern Pipeline Co. vs. State Highway Commission, 294 US 613\n\n\"It is well settled that the Constitutional Rights protected from invasion by the police power, include Rights safeguarded both by express and implied prohibitions in the Constitutions.\"\nTiche vs. Osborne, 131 A. 60\n\n\"As a rule, fundamental limitations of regulations under the police power are found in the spirit of the Constitutions, not in the letter, although they are just as efficient as if expressed in the clearest language.\"\nMehlos vs. Milwaukee, 146 NW 882\n\nAs it applies in the instant case, the language of the Fifth Amendment is clear:\n\n\"No person shall be ... deprived of Life, Liberty, or Property without due process of law.\"\nAs has been shown, the courts at all levels have firmly established an absolute Right to travel.\n\nIn the instant case, the state, by applying commercial statutes to all entities, natural and artificial persons alike, has deprived this free and natural person of the Right of Liberty, without cause and without due process of law.\n\nDUE PROCESS\n\n\"The essential elements of due process of law are ... Notice and The Opportunity to defend.\"\nSimon vs. Craft, 182 US 427\n\nYet, not one individual has been given notice of the loss of his\/her Right, let alone before signing the license (contract). Nor was the Citizen given any opportunity to defend against the loss of his\/her right to travel, by automobile, on the highways, in the ordinary course of life and business. This amounts to an arbitrary deprivation of Liberty.\n\n\"There should be no arbitrary deprivation of Life or Liberty ...\"\nBarbour vs. Connolly, 113 US 27, 31; \nYick Wo vs. Hopkins, 118 US 356\n\nand ...\n\n\"The right to travel is part of the Liberty of which a citizen cannot deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. This Right was emerging as early as the Magna Carta.\"\nKent vs. Dulles, 357 US 116 (1958)\n\nThe focal point of this question of police power and due process must balance upon the point of making the public highways a safe place for the public to travel. If a man travels in a manner that creates actual damage, an action would lie (civilly) for recovery of damages. The state could then also proceed against the individual to deprive him of his Right to use the public highways, for cause. This process would fulfill the due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment while at the same time insuring that Rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the state constitutions would be protected.\n\nBut unless or until harm or damage (a crime) is committed, there is no cause for interference in the private affairs or actions of a Citizen.\n\nOne of the most famous and perhaps the most quoted definitions of due process of law, is that of Daniel Webster in his Dartmouth College Case (4 Wheat 518), in which he declared that by due process is meant:\n\n\"a law which hears before it condemns, which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial.\"\nSee also State vs. Strasburg, 110 P. 1020; \nDennis vs. Moses, 52 P. 333\n\nSomewhat similar is the statement that is a rule as old as the law that:\n\n\"no one shall be personally bound (restricted) until he has had his day in court,\"\nby which is meant, until he has been duly cited to appear and has been afforded an opportunity to be heard. Judgment without such citation and opportunity lacks all the attributes of a judicial determination; it is judicial usurpation and it is oppressive and can never be upheld where it is fairly administered. (12 Am.Jur. [1st] Const. Law, Sect. 573, Pg. 269)\n\nNote: This sounds like the process used to deprive one of the \"privilege\" of operating a motor vehicle \"for hire.\" It should be kept in mind, however, that we are discussing the arbitrary deprivation of the Right to use the road that all citizens have \"in common.\"\n\nThe futility of the state's position can be most easily observed in the 1959 Washington Attorney General's opinion on a similar issue:\n\n\"The distinction between the Right of the Citizen to use the public highways for private, rather than commercial purposes is recognized ...\"\nand ...\n\n\"Under its power to regulate private uses of our highways, our legislature has required that motor vehicle operators be licensed (I.C. 49-307). Undoubtedly, the primary purpose of this requirement is to insure, as far as possible, that all motor vehicle operators will be competent and qualified, thereby reducing the potential hazard or risk of harm, to which other users of the highways might otherwise be subject. But once having complied with this regulatory provision, by obtaining the required license, a motorist enjoys the privilege of travelling freely upon the highways ...\"\nWashington A.G.O. 59-60 No. 88, Pg. 11\n\nThis alarming opinion appears to be saying that every person using an automobile as a matter of Right, must give up the Right and convert the Right into a privilege. This is accomplished under the guise of regulation. This statement is indicative of the insensitivity, even the ignorance, of the government to the limits placed upon governments by and through the several constitutions.\n\nThis legal theory may have been able to stand in 1959; however, as of 1966, in the United States Supreme Court decision in Miranda, even this weak defense of the state's actions must fall.\n\n\"Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.\"\nMiranda vs. Arizona, 384 US 436, 491\n\nThus the legislature does not have the power to abrogate the Citizen's Right to travel upon the public roads, by passing legislation forcing the citizen to waive his Right and convert that Right into a privilege. Furthermore, we have previously established that this \"privilege\" has been defined as applying only to those who are \"conducting business in the streets\" or \"operating for-hire vehicles.\"\n\nThe legislature has attempted (by legislative fiat) to deprive the Citizen of his Right to use the roads in the ordinary course of life and business, without affording the Citizen the safeguard of due process of law. This has been accomplished under supposed powers of regulation.\n\nREGULATION\n\n\"In addition to the requirement that regulations governing the use of the highways must not be violative of constitutional guarantees, the prime essentials of such regulation are reasonableness, impartiality, and definiteness or certainty.\"\n25 Am.Jur. (1st) Highways, Sect. 260\n\nand ...\n\n\"Moreover, a distinction must be observed between the regulation of an activity which may be engaged in as a matter of right and one carried on by government sufferance of permission.\"\nDavis vs. Massachusetts, 167 US 43; \nPachard vs. Banton, supra.\n\nOne can say for certain that these regulations are impartial since they are being applied to all, even though they are clearly beyond the limits of the legislative powers. However, we must consider whether such regulations are reasonable and non-violative of constitutional guarantees.\n\nFirst, let us consider the reasonableness of this statute requiring all persons to be licensed (presuming that we are applying this statute to all persons using the public roads). In determining the reasonableness of the statute we need only ask two questions:\n\nDoes the statute accomplish its stated goal?\nThe answer is No!\n\nThe attempted explanation for this regulation \"to insure the safety of the public by insuring, as much as possible, that all are competent and qualified.\"\n\nHowever, one can keep his license without retesting, from the time he\/she is first licensed until the day he\/she dies, without regard to the competency of the person, by merely renewing said license before it expires. It is therefore possible to completely skirt the goal of this attempted regulation, thus proving that this regulation does not accomplish its goal.\n\nFurthermore, by testing and licensing, the state gives the appearance of underwriting the competence of the licensees, and could therefore be held liable for failures, accidents, etc. caused by licensees.\n\nIs the statute reasonable?\nThe answer is No!\n\nThis statute cannot be determined to be reasonable since it requires to the Citizen to give up his or her natural Right to travel unrestricted in order to accept the privilege. The purported goal of this statute could be met by much less oppressive regulations, i.e., competency tests and certificates of competency before using an automobile upon the public roads. (This is exactly the situation in the aviation sector.)\n\nBut isn't this what we have now?\n\nThe answer is No! The real purpose of this license is much more insidious. When one signs the license, he\/she gives up his\/her Constitutional Right to travel in order to accept and exercise a privilege. After signing the license, a quasi-contract, the Citizen has to give the state his\/her consent to be prosecuted for constructive crimes and quasi-criminal actions where there is no harm done and no damaged property.\n\nThese prosecutions take place without affording the Citizen of their Constitutional Rights and guarantees such a the Right to a trial by jury of twelve persons and the Right to counsel, as well as the normal safeguards such as proof of intent and a corpus dilecti and a grand jury indictment. These unconstitutional prosecutions take place because the Citizen is exercising a privilege and has given his\/her \"implied consent\" to legislative enactments designed to control interstate commerce, a regulatable enterprise under the police power of the state.\n\nWe must now conclude that the Citizen is forced to give up Constitutional guarantees of \"Right\" in order to exercise his state \"privilege\" to travel upon the public highways in the ordinary course of life and business.\n\nSURRENDER OF RIGHTS\n\nA Citizen cannot be forced to give up his\/her Rights in the name of regulation.\n\n\"... the only limitations found restricting the right of the state to condition the use of the public highways as a means of vehicular transportation for compensation are (1) that the state must not exact of those it permits to use the highways for hauling for gain that they surrender any of their inherent U.S. Constitutional Rights as a condition precedent to obtaining permission for such use ...\"\nRiley vs. Laeson, 142 So. 619; \nStephenson vs. Binford, supra.\n\nIf one cannot be placed in a position of being forced to surrender Rights in order to exercise a privilege, how much more must this maxim of law, then, apply when one is simply exercising (putting into use) a Right?\n\nHoke vs. Henderson, 15 NC 15\n\nand ...\n\n\"We find it intolerable that one Constitutional Right should have to be surrendered in order to assert another.\"\nSimons vs. United States, 390 US 389\n\nSince the state requires that one give up Rights in order to exercise the privilege of driving, the regulation cannot stand under the police power, due process, or regulation, but must be exposed as a statute which is oppressive and one which has been misapplied to deprive the Citizen of Rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the state constitutions.\n\nTAXING POWER\n\n\"Any claim that this statute is a taxing statute would be immediately open to severe Constitutional objections. If it could be said that the state had the power to tax a Right, this would enable the state to destroy Rights guaranteed by the constitution through the use of oppressive taxation. The question herein, is one of the state taxing the Right to travel by the ordinary modes of the day, and whether this is a legislative object of the state taxation.\nThe views advanced herein are neither novel nor unsupported by authority. The question of taxing power of the states has been repeatedly considered by the Supreme Court. The Right of the state to impede or embarrass the Constitutional operation of the U.S. Government or the Rights which the Citizen holds under it, has been uniformly denied.\"\n\nMcCulloch vs. Maryland, 4 Wheat 316\n\nThe power to tax is the power to destroy, and if the state is given the power to destroy Rights through taxation, the framers of the Constitution wrote that document in vain.\n\n\"... It may be said that a tax of one dollar for passing through the state cannot sensibly affect any function of government or deprive a Citizen of any valuable Right. But if a state can tax ... a passenger of one dollar, it can tax him a thousand dollars.\"\nCrandall vs. Nevada, 6 Wall 35, 46\n\nand ...\n\n\"If the Right of passing through a state by a Citizen of the United States is one guaranteed by the Constitution, it must be sacred from state taxation.\"\nIbid., Pg. 47\n\nTherefore, the Right of travel must be kept sacred from all forms of state taxation and if this argument is used by the state as a defense of the enforcement of this statute, then this argument also must fail.\n\nCONVERSION OF A RIGHT TO A CRIME\n\nAs previously demonstrated, the Citizen has the Right to travel and to transport his property upon the public highways in the ordinary course of life and business. However, if one exercises this Right to travel (without first giving up the Right and converting that Right into a privilege) the Citizen is by statute, guilty of a crime. This amounts to converting the exercise of a Constitutional Right into a crime.\n\nRecall the Miller vs. U.S. and Snerer vs. Cullen quotes from Pg. 5, and:\n\n\"The state cannot diminish Rights of the people.\"\nHurtado vs. California, 110 US 516\n\nand ...\n\n\"Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.\"\nMiranda, supra.\n\nIndeed, the very purpose for creating the state under the limitations of the constitution was to protect the rights of the people from intrusion, particularly by the forces of government.\n\nSo we can see that any attempt by the legislature to make the act of using the public highways as a matter of Right into a crime, is void upon its face.\n\nAny person who claims his Right to travel upon the highways, and so exercises that Right, cannot be tried for a crime of doing so. And yet, this Freeman stands before this court today to answer charges for the \"crime\" of exercising his Right to Liberty. As we have already shown, the term \"drive\" can only apply to those who are employed in the business of transportation for hire. It has been shown that freedom includes the Citizen's Right to use the public highways in the ordinary course of life and business without license or regulation by the police powers of the state.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt is the duty of the court to recognize the substance of things and not the mere form.\n\n\"The courts are not bound by mere form, nor are they to be misled by mere pretenses. They are at liberty -- indeed they are under a solemn duty -- to look at the substance of things, whenever they enter upon the inquiry whether the legislature has transcended the limits of its authority. If, therefore, a statute purported to have been enacted to protect ... the public safety, has no real or substantial relation to those objects or is a palpable invasion of Rights secured by the fundamental law, it is the duty of the courts to so adjudge, and thereby give effect to the Constitution.\"\nMulger vs. Kansas, 123 US 623, 661\n\nand ...\n\n\"It is the duty of the courts to be watchful for the Constitutional rights of the citizen and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.\"\nBoyd vs. United States, 116 US 616\n\nThe courts are duty bound to recognize and stop the stealthy encroachments which have been made upon the Citizen's Right to travel and to use the roads to transport his property in the \"ordinary course of life and business.\" (Hadfield, supra.)\n\nFurther, the court must recognize that the Right to travel is part of the Liberty of which a Citizen cannot be deprived without specific cause and without the due process of law guaranteed in the Fifth Amendment. (Kent, supra.)\n\nThe history of this invasion of the Citizen's Right to use the public highways shows clearly that the legislature simply found a heretofore untapped source of revenue, got greedy, and attempted to enforce a statute in an unconstitutional manner upon those free and natural individuals who have a Right to travel upon the highways. This was not attempted in an outright action, but in a slow, meticulous, calculated encroachment upon the Citizen's Right to travel.\n\nThis position must be accepted unless the prosecutor can show his authority for the position that the \"use of the road in the ordinary course of life and business\" is a privilege.\n\nTo rule in any other manner, without clear authority for an adverse ruling, will infringe upon fundamental and basic concepts of Constitutional law. This position, that a Right cannot be regulated under any guise, must be accepted without concern for the monetary loss of the state.\n\n\"Disobedience or evasion of a Constitutional Mandate cannot be tolerated, even though such disobedience may, at least temporarily, promote in some respects the best interests of the public.\"\nSlote vs. Examination, 112 ALR 660\n\nand ...\n\n\"Economic necessity cannot justify a disregard of Constitutional guarantee.\"\nRiley vs. Carter, 79 ALR 1018; \n16 Am.Jur. (2nd), Const. Law, Sect. 81\n\nand ...\n\n\"Constitutional Rights cannot be denied simply because of hostility to their assertions and exercise; vindication of conceded Constitutional Rights cannot be made dependent upon any theory that it is less expensive to deny them than to afford them.\"\nWatson vs. Memphis, 375 US 526\n\nTherefore, the Court's decision in the instant case must be made without the issue of cost to the state being taken into consideration, as that issue is irrelevant. The state cannot lose money that it never had a right to demand from the Sovereign People.\n\nFinally, we come to the issue of public policy. It could be argued that the licensing scheme of all persons is a matter of public policy. However, if this argument is used, it too must fail, as:\n\n\"No public policy of a state can be allowed to override the positive guarantees of the U.S. Constitution.\"\n16 Am.Jur. (2nd), Const. Law, Sect. 70\n\nSo even public policy cannot abrogate this Citizen's Right to travel and to use the public highways in the ordinary course of life and business. Therefore, it must be concluded that:\n\n\"We have repeatedly held that the legislature may regulate the use of the highways for carrying on business for private gain and that such regulation is a valid exercise of the police power.\"\nNorthern Pacific R.R. Co., supra.\n\nand ...\n\n\"The act in question is a valid regulation, and as such is binding upon all who use the highway for the purpose of private gain.\"\nIbid.\n\nAny other construction of this statute would render it unconstitutional as applied to this Citizen or any Citizen. The Accused therefore moves this court to dismiss the charge against him, with prejudice.\n\nJune 10, 1986. \nThis ends the legal brief. \n\nIn addition:\n\nSince no notice is given to people applying for driver's (or other) licenses that they have a perfect right to use the roads without any permission, and that they surrender valuable rights by taking on the regulation system of licensure, the state has committed a massive construction fraud. This occurs when any person is told that they must have a license in order to use the public roads and highways.\n\nThe license, being a legal contract under which the state is empowered with policing powers, is only valid when the licensee takes on the burdens of the contract and bargains away his or her rights knowingly, intentionally, and voluntarily.\n\nFew know that the driver's license is a contract without which the police are powerless to regulate the people's actions or activities.\n\nFew (if any) licensees intentionally surrender valuable rights. They are told that they must have the license. As we have seen, this is not the case.\n\nNo one in their right mind voluntarily surrenders complete liberty and accepts in its place a set of regulations.\n\n\"The people never give up their liberties but under some delusion.\"\nEdmund Burke, (1784)","updated_time":"2016-04-05T23:05:24+0000","id":"394462630661212_954794394628030"},{"message":"A Key Similarity Between Snowden Leak and Panama Papers: Scandal Is What\u2019s Been Legalized ~ see article here: http:\/\/wp.me\/p2X3AR-fVM","story":"Pam Barker shared The Liberty Beacon's photo to the group: Constitutional Patriots.","updated_time":"2016-04-05T16:06:53+0000","id":"394462630661212_954606394646830"},{"message":"http:\/\/www.washingtonstarnews.com\/watch-donald-j-trump-calls-the-process-of-a-contested-convention-crooked-as-hell\/ |","updated_time":"2016-04-05T13:44:23+0000","id":"394462630661212_954258864681583"},{"story":"Larry Hilt shared Americans Defending The 2nd's photo to the group: Constitutional Patriots.","updated_time":"2016-04-05T13:19:59+0000","id":"394462630661212_954531347987668"},{"updated_time":"2016-04-05T13:13:27+0000","id":"394462630661212_954528377987965"},{"story":"Larry Hilt shared Allen West Republic's photo to the group: Constitutional Patriots.","updated_time":"2016-04-05T12:35:17+0000","id":"394462630661212_954515151322621"},{"message":"Convention of States usurps the Sovereignty and Deliberative Status of your State Legislatures by allowing unelected \"Commissioners\" to write the Amendments, which is your State Legislators job.

The \u201cTrump Doctrine\u201d is a page right out of Ronald Reagan\u2019s playbook: peace through economic and military strength.\n\nTrump knows the key to keeping America safe in an increasingly dangerous world is to \u201cmake America great again\u201d through economic renewal. America must have the fiscal firepower to end Pentagon\u2019s budget sequestration in order to fund the military the U.S. needs for adequate defense. Cutting the corporate tax rate and cracking down on unfair trade practices to increase America\u2019s GDP growth rate are just as demonstrative of national might as the F-35. Here is how President Trump would use a newly empowered economy and military confront our rivals abroad:\n\nDefeating Daesh\n\nThe best way to kill ISIS is to cut off its own financial head in two ways: first, target any oil fields that it may be using as a cash register and \u201cfollow the money\u201d through the Internet and expropriate it. Trump is probably aware of Nietzsche\u2019s admonition to beware that \u201cwhen fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster.\u201d Trump also knows that when you are facing an enemy willing to bomb your sons and daughters and behead prisoners, you must strike equal fear into the heart of that enemy. Under a Trump Administration, no ISIS member will be safe, the cells of Guantanamo will be fuller, and America will be safer.\n\nOverturning the Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nTrump believes, as the strange bedfellows of Saudi Arabia and Israel are wont to do, that the Obama administration has made a terrible deal with Iran. Removing sanctions will allow this fascist, terrorist state to restore it economy and continue to develop capabilities to deliver nuclear warheads as near as Riyadh and Tel Aviv and as far away as Brussels and New York. President Trump will abrogate that deal the day he takes office. As commander in chief, he will exert both economic and military pressure on Saudi Arabia, our quasi-enemy that has pledged to destroy Israel and dreams of ruling a new Middle Eastern caliphate. As far as Israel is concerned, however, Trump appears to regards this democratic state as America\u2019s most important ally in the Middle East. But Trump, along with most Americans, disagrees with hardliners who insist there can be no deal brokered between Israel and the Palestinians. A deal is possible, but you cannot have peace unless you are willing to negotiate.\n\nFrom Russia, With Revanchism\n\nTrump recognizes Vladimir Putin for the clever, ruthless, charismatic leader that he is. Putin has run strategic circles around both America and its NATO allies when it comes to Russia\u2019s military intervention in Crimea, Ukraine, Syria, and former Socialist Republics like Georgia and Latvia.\n\nPutin recognizes Trump as a strong and fearless leader who will draw clear red lines in Europe and the Middle East that Putin dare not cross. This is a far better and safer situation for America than a status quo Russia policy that leads from behind and inspires far more contempt from Putin than respect.\n\nChina\u2019s Rising Phoenix\n\nTrump will no longer tolerate a mercantilist China having its way with America\u2019s factories and jobs. He will firmly crack down on unfair trade practices like illegal export subsidies, currency manipulation, and intellectual property theft and bring American jobs and factories home.\n\nThat\u2019s not just good trade policy\u2014it\u2019s good foreign policy, too. China\u2019s rapidly advancing military strength has been its ability to economically grow much faster than its strategic rivals. In other words, by rebalancing trade between the US and China, Trump will also rebalance the military equation in America\u2019s favor.\n\nSharing the Burden of Defense\n\nTrump has made headlines about revamping America\u2019s alliances\u2014from NATO to our allies in Asia. Trump knows the problem here is not that these alliances are not useful to the defense of the American homeland. Rather, Trump is tired of the U.S. having to pay the lion\u2019s share of the bill to protect wealthier nations unwilling to spend the requisite funds to defend their own homelands. Consider that while the U.S. spends fully 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense, Japan is at a measly 1.0 percent, Germany is at 1.1 percent, and even South Korea, with an absolute madman on its border contributes a measly 2.6 percent. As president, Trump will demand a better deal for American taxpayers.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cDistributed Network\u201d of Advisors\n\nIn laying out his Trump Doctrine, Trump has assiduously avoided surrounding himself with a large circle of advisors. He has done so because he has \u201coff the record\u201d access to a broad distributed network of experts around the world\u2014as well as an inner circle that stays out of the limelight. From his own detailed foreign policy research over many years\u2014required due diligence to conduct business globally\u2014Trump has developed a strong aversion to the kind of \u201cnation building\u201d that dragged America into wasted and protracted wars in God-forsaken killing fields like Iraq and Afghanistan. Accordingly, Trump has promised the American people \u2013 he will not be shedding the blood of any American soldier either in vain or under the vanity banner of American Exceptionalism. This is how Trump is in tune with the American public that is both tired of war and ready for the new era of prosperity that will usher in peace founded on true American power.\n\n","updated_time":"2016-04-03T15:38:45+0000","id":"394462630661212_953426241431512"},{"message":"Cruz supporters are out in force bragging about his foreign policy team.

Among other regulatory reforms, governments should consider the benefits of allowing North American transportation firms unlimited access to each others\u2019 territory, including provision for full cabotage (trade between two points within a country; for example, a Canadian trucker hauling freight from Chicago to Los Angeles or an American airline carrying passengers between Mexico City and Monterrey) for airlines and surface carriers.\n ########################\n\nExpand temporary migrant worker programs (p27):\n\nCanada and the United States should expand programs for temporary labor migration from Mexico. For instance, Canada\u2019s successful model for managing seasonal migration in the agricultural sector should be expanded to other sectors where Canadian producers face a shortage of workers and Mexico may have a surplus of workers with appropriate skills. Canadian and U.S. retirees living in Mexico should be granted working permits in certain fields, for instance as English teachers.\n ########################\n\nMove to full labor mobility between Canada and the United States (p27-28):\n\nTo make companies based in North America as competitive as possible in the global economy, Canada and the United States should consider eliminating all remaining barriers to the ability of their citizens to live and work in the other country. This free flow of people would offer an important advantage to employers in both countries by giving them rapid access to a larger pool of skilled labor, and would enhance the well-being of individuals in both countries by enabling them to move quickly to where their skills are needed. In the long term, the two countries should work to extend this policy to Mexico as well, though doing so will not be practical until wage differentials between Mexico and its two North American neighbors have diminished considerably.\n ########################\n\nA North American Advisory Council (p31):\n\nTo ensure a regular injection of creative energy into the various efforts related to North American integration, the three governments should appoint an independent body of advisers. This body should be composed of eminent persons from outside government, appointed to staggered multiyear terms to ensure their independence. Their mandate would be to engage in creative exploration of new ideas from a North American perspective and to provide a public voice for North America. A complementary approach would be to establish private bodies that would meet regularly or annually to buttress North American relationships, along the lines of the Bilderberg or Wehr-kunde conferences, organized to support transatlantic relations.\n ########################\n \nAll the report recommendations that Heidi Cruz said, in her own words, she supports, are from pages 7 through 32 in the pdf document","updated_time":"2016-04-03T14:28:33+0000","id":"394462630661212_953393298101473"},{"story":"Niki Hannevig shared Fox News Sunday's video to the group: Constitutional Patriots.","updated_time":"2016-04-03T13:58:06+0000","id":"394462630661212_953373674770102"},{"updated_time":"2016-04-03T13:34:12+0000","id":"394462630661212_951405811633555"},{"message":"http:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/news\/politics\/article\/Kasich-tells-Wisconsin-GOP-I-don-t-even-like-7223733.php","updated_time":"2016-04-03T13:18:55+0000","id":"394462630661212_953358494771620"},{"message":"Gingrich On Trump - Wisconsin, Unforced Errors And The Very Green Grass Ahead  \n\n","updated_time":"2016-04-03T13:00:23+0000","id":"394462630661212_953351014772368"},{"updated_time":"2016-04-03T10:26:54+0000","id":"394462630661212_953292838111519"},{"message":"Anyone who chooses A is a domestic enemy.","updated_time":"2016-04-03T08:26:23+0000","id":"394462630661212_953256288115174"},{"story":"Seamus Hall McManus shared Patriots Global Alli\u00e1nce's photo to the group: Constitutional Patriots.","updated_time":"2016-04-03T07:35:06+0000","id":"394462630661212_951133521660784"},{"message":"The vets are the backbone of our nation.","updated_time":"2016-04-03T07:29:19+0000","id":"394462630661212_952996524807817"},{"message":"Pew Research, using Federal Reserve data AFTER the Great Recession (exclusively Obama\u2019s watch; 2010 - 2013) found that: \u201cthe median wealth of non-Hispanic black households FELL 33.7\u0025, from $16,600 in 2010 to $11,000 in 2013.

Said driver\/operator is affirmed in obedience for the protection of the Constitution for the United States of America and may be detained only upon sworn complaint of an injured party as per the Bill of Rights, Article IV, and common law. The undersigned claims his rights at law as a Sovereign citizen (NOT a resident) of Colorado state, and rejects, and is not subject to, the contract obligations in equity known as the Motor Vehicle Codes of the respective states, via U.C.C. 1.\n\nNotice: The \"driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license\" demanded, and provided under duress, which is issued by the state of Colorado, is NOT legally issued to me as a secured party with respect to the named party on the license, JEFFREY T. MAEHR, in all caps.\n\nCase Law: (Emphasis mine throughout)\n\nAmericans' \"freedom to travel throughout the United States has long been recognized as a basic right under the Constitution,\" according to multiple cases including Williams v Fears, 179 US 270, 274; 21 S Ct 128; 45 L Ed 186 (1900); Twining v New Jersey, 211 US 78, 97; 29 S Ct 14; 53 L Ed 97 (1908), as listed in the case of United States v Guest, 383 US 745; 86 S Ct 1170; 16 L Ed 2d 239 (1968), a case involving criminally prosecuting people for obstructing the right (obstruction is a federal crime pursuant to federal criminal law 18 USC 241).\n\nCase law shows that the \"liberty\" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment extends beyond freedom from bodily restraint and includes a much wider range of human activity, including but not limited to the opportunity to make a wide range of personal decisions concerning one's life, family, and private pursuits. See Meyer v, 262 US 390, 399; 43 SCt 625, 626; 67 L Ed 1043 (1923), and Roe v Wade, 410 US 113, 152-153; 93 S Ct 705, 726-727; 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973). One of these life, family, private pursuits is obviously driving.\n\nIn effect, as per the Supreme Court decision in the case of Crandall v Nevada, 73 US 35; 18 L Ed (1867), speed limits and other traffic control devices, being non-fact-based, are simply an unlawful tax or impost on travel, and thus unconstitutional for the reason cited in Crandall. (Crandall involved a tax on travelers! which is what in essence speed limits, unscientific stop signs, etc., simply are, stripped of all the phony fraudulent politician folderol pretending them to relate somehow to safety, not to mention that are extortion violating the federal anti-racketeering act (RICO), 18 USC 1961 and the law against obstructing federal rights, 18 USC 241).\n\n42-2-101.

Since an unconstitutional law is void, the general principles follow that it imposes no duties, confers no right, creates no office, bestows no power or authority on anyone, affords no protection and justifies no acts performed under it... A void act cannot be legally consistent with a valid one. An unconstitutional law cannot operate to supersede any existing law. Indeed insofar as a statute runs counter to the fundamental law of the land, (the Constitution JTM) it is superseded thereby.

One BLM crew started at the south end of the ranch and the second BLM crew started on the east side of the ranch creating a horseshoe of fire around the Hammond ranch. The Hammond\u2019s responded with lighting back burns to prevent fire spread onto their ranch, protecting their private property. The witness was interview by Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) Frank Papagni, Jr.. AUSA Papagni never called on this witness, nor in pre-trial discovery reported to the defense the existence of these witnesses.\nTherefore;\nCitizens for Constitutional Freedom request the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conduct a criminal investigation into prosecutorial misconduct for unlawfully withholding eyewitness testimony which would have aided in the Hammond\u2019s defense. The withholding of evidence and actions by US Attorney Amanda Marshal has further led to the violation of the Hammond\u2019s 5th Amendment and 8th Amendment Constitutional Rights.\nIf this is true, Assistant US Attorney Frank Papagni, Jr. is guilty of criminal misconduct. He knew of these witnesses, (it is alleged), yet refused to divulge their existence to defense attorneys, as he is required by law to do. Had the Hammonds\u2019 lawyers known of their existence, the outcome of the trial might have been different. US Attorney, as head of the US Attorney\u2019s office in Oregon is equally culpable. The Hammonds were tried as terrorists, for God knows what reason, for setting backfires on their property on one instance, to protect their property, and for burning their fields, in another, the fire getting out of control and spreading onto the BLM land. Yet, the BLM has lost control of its controlled burns, burning private land, yet they shrug it off as collateral damage, with the private landowners receiving no compensation. Meanwhile, the BLM received a judgement of $400,000 from the Hammonds. To put it mildly, it is insane.\nUS Attorney Amanda Marshall, an Obama appointee, is a piece of work. She resigned because of allegations by one of her Assistant Attorneys, that she was stalking him. You can find out her story here, here and here.\nDid the BLM and the Oregon US Attorney\u2019s office conspire to railroad the Hammond family? It is time for a thorough investigation by the FBI. If the claims of criminal misconduct against Assistant US Attorney Papagni, Jr. are valid, he should be removed from his office and tried in court.

This means that if the current recovery had been only average, then after-tax per person income would be $3,339 per year higher. That puts a lot of additional folks above minimum wage without government intervention that some argue loses jobs.\n\nToday there are 94 million people over age 16 not working.

TRUMP!\n\nWe will BOYCOTT \"Meet The Press\". CNN and the other Soviet-Style Propaganda Networks to do so!\n\nPlease copy, paste and spread this message and save and attach to the photo to whatever groups you are within reach of.\n\nWe can longer support the sponsors of \"Meet The Press\" and all of CNN any longer after the blatant Soviet-Union Style Propaganda they used to try and destroy the candidacy of Donald J. Trump. This includes unfairly quoting him with words he never even uttered and trying to paint him as a racist while he was drawing away the Black American votes from the Clinton campaign in droves. It includes the plot to pump Rafael \"Ted\" Cruz, who is sponsored by Goldman Sachs like the Clintons along with their substitute alternative insurance candidates. This is while their mathematicians and experts in demography have determined that Rafael Cruz could never win an election nationwide against Clinton and that Donald Trump is the only candidate that can. \n\nfacebook.com\/proudtobeguilty\n\nNOW WE LAUNCH A FULL OUT BOYCOTT OF ALL SPONSORS OF CNN AND ALL SPONSORS OF \"MEET THE PRESS\" THAT BEGINS TODAY! \n\nFeel free to throw in the other networks early, if you wish, who are equally guilty. It is not hard to do. Keep a pen and pad next your television and jot down those products and candidates that sponsor these programs or begin a list of incumbents who do not endorse Trump so we can vote them out at the appropriate time. Money is the only language the criminals understand.\n\nI can not sit back and watch the Propaganda reminiscent of the Communist Soviet Union continue any longer. Chuck \"Clodd\" of \"Meet The Press\" made it no secret that Donald Trump was fair game before he ever even announced his candidacy and the facts are all over the internet. CNN has turned their network into a 24 hour infomercial in attacking Trump, pumping Hitlerly and boosting all of Trump's opponents who can not mathematically or demographically beat Hitlerly Clinton in a national election made up of a unified Democratic and Republican populous alike who overwhelmingly support the Trump Revolution!\n\nUnity is what this is all about and only has it been President Donald J. Trump's agenda since day one while all the rest continue to divide the nation through partisan bickering which makes little sense 99\u0025 of the time.\n\nCruz and Kasich have not been hit with any hard questions on foreign policy and while Trump gives specific answers as he did in concerning nuclear attacks, Isis and so many other foreign policy questions, he is completely demonstrative of his broad field of knowledge in much the way he makes sense of the country's even bigger economic problems. \n\nMeanwhile, the press turned around with questions to Trump's opponents that not only made no sense whatsoever but suggested they were all having the same flashbacks from the 60s while they were dropping acid with the Clintons in the mud at Woodstock and painting flowers on their body parts. I was just waiting for Cruz to respond to the ever so important question posed to him concerning Isis as \"you bet your sweet bippy\" but in his usual style of Soviet-type propaganda, he completely switched the topic around in that interview while switching the focus on his wife Heidi's intimate and financial arrangements of the past with Goldman Sachs. LOL, I don't think he thought that one through much since in sharp contrast, the public is still outraged that he hid his Goldman Sachs' financing and covered up that Heidi, his wife, served as their VP. I guess he had to take the focus of the most revolting fotos of Heidi which Cruz himself was the cause of them going around since he started some tit for tat game with his own wife as bait. Seriously folks, was their ever any competition as to who's wife is sexier but this is the game of mudslinging Cruz chose to fight. Botttom line...Trump and Melania win and Heidi and Cruz...LOOOSE!. I mean seriously folks, this Rafael Cruz is mentally unstable to be such a lowlife and drag his whole family into this but it certainly backfired on him!. What kind of moron would begin a war of the wives like that when Heidi can't hold a candle to Trump's wife Melania? Duh? Onlu a moron named Rafael \"Ted\" Cruz in is Elmer Fudd Halloween Costume.\n\nAnd with all due respect, Trump, has never once tried to use his wife's beautiful and stunning appearance to win votes while keeping her out of the spotlight. Cruz is a very sick individual but in the end, all he has done is focused on his wife's very shady ties to Goldman Sachs which has already been killing Hitlerly and Slick Willie in the polls as a conflict of interest in their run for the Presidency. Then again, Rafael Cruz might have been wearing his Elmer Fudd costome that day and thinking he was meeting with the tea party folk he has folked and forgot to stick on the Armani suit while actually going to Goldman Sachs' fundraiser. It must get confusing for him to wear so many different hats while Donald Trump is who he says he is and never tries to back away from hi strong viewpoints as any good leader should do. . , all other candidates seem to be clueless on foreign policy which is especially embarrassing to Hitlerly Clinton who has seemed more clueless than all of them put together. Her solution to defeating terrorism seems to be picking daises and citing 'she loves me, she loses me not\", when she was hit up with the hard questions. Was this woman really ever Secretary of State or were the front men who handle her lies about the servers the ones who were calling the shots while she was off on shopping sprees with Chelsea?. Meanwhile Rafael \"Ted\" Cruz, Kasich , Clinton and Sanders are handled with kit gloves on questions on foreign policy while Hitlerly, the disaster of all disasters as the Secretary of State; who negligently murdered Americans in Benghazi is hailed in some la-la land world of \"Meet the Press\" as some kind of foreign policy wizard. This, we are talking about,is the same beast that assassinated Qaddafi, a world leader of Libya, laughed about it on national television and gave rise to one of the worst terrorist groups threatening harm here a home against our own people as a result of her such poorly thought out actions. Need I say more?\n\nTo add insult to injury, concerning the Rafael \"Ted\" Cruz sleazy campaign attack against Donald Trump's very beautiful and classy wife while Cruz could only dream of having her in his own bedroom and then the networks along with his own Soviet Style propaganda machine try to blame his vicious attack on Trump.\n\nHow sleazy can one man like Rafael Cruz possibly get. If you want to talk about sleaze, let's talk about the whores at the bunny ranch where Heidi is party to that includes the Clintons themselves who have billed out for $675K per speech (oral sex is what some may call it) to their pimps at Goldman Sachs and also share membership with Rafael himself who had a million bucks left on the night stand that he failed ti file with the government ( tin his defense(I am told most whores don't file with the government plus, his defense was that he was f'ing over the American people so they should foot the bill).) And if you dig down deep long enough, you will easily find a whole orgy of Ted Trump's other opponents sacking up with Goldman Sachs or some of the other \"special interests\" groups who I am told get really kinky! Anyway, as usual, we can't blame Kasich, Cruz, Hitlerly or Sanders that much because from what I am told, it's their \"pimps\" that get the big percentages and that is why they have been giving away free XXX-rated programming on CNN, \"Meet the Press\" and the other networks, soon to be added to the list, that have been willing to air just about anything the FCC will allow them in order to keep the ole boys club goin'. They seem to think Donald may clean house and that has them all worried that the Donald may air his on his own infomercial...you know , the one where it outlines how the the 2008 worldwide crash, as portrayed in the latest DVD and movie \"The Big Short\" was allowed to happen by Slick Willie Clinton signing CFMA in the early 2000s under the engineering of Alan Greenspan. You know, where Greenspan was specifically mentioned as one of the chief pimps in the movie who acted under both the Clinton and Bush Dynasty. Dynasties that ended up becoming one in the same and where all those crooks in both the Republican and Democratic parties , serving in Congress and now dissing Donald, had their hand in it and in the piggy bank.. Now isn't tht special that neither party wants the Donald running against Hitlerly because none of them wants all those dirty beans spilled all over the Congressional floors and after all, what else is Donald's bets line of attack in a Trump vs. Hillary campaign while all Hillary has to work with is lies and sharp-shooters.\n\nSo please, begin your boycotting of the networks now so that after we get Trump elected, we can return to regular programming where CNN teaches your young and impressionable children that Caitlin Jenner, formerly their hero on the Wheaties Boxes known as Bruce Jenner, no longer has a penis but us an American hero for slicing it off. I know how anxious you are all are waiting to get back t that brand of entertainment that the FCC adores! \n\nIf you missed the episode, Mittler Romney plays it every night with his venture vulture buddies. It is their favorite CNN segment and he is still trying to get Rafael to endorse Caitlin as VP since she endorses Rafael. \n\nTHE TIME FOR ACTION IS NOW. FIRST WE MUST BOYCOTT ALL NBC and CNN SPONSORS AND PUT FOX, CBS AND ABC ON NOTICE THAT THEY SHALL BE NEXT.\n\nBOYCOTT, BOYCOTT, BOYCOTT, BOYCOTT! \n\n DON'T BE A CHUMP, VOTE FOR TRUMP... by the way, the best bet at this point is to lock in your votes for Trump now and completely delete these channels from your set.","story":"Bob Sallese shared Proud To Be Guilty  with Bob Sallese's photo to the group: Constitutional Patriots.","updated_time":"2016-03-29T00:41:45+0000","id":"394462630661212_948279785279491"},{"message":"Help us bypass Congress to restore States Rights and power as intended by the Constitution.\nSign the Convention of States Petition http:\/\/www.cosaction.com\/?recruiter_id=2750","updated_time":"2016-03-28T22:37:47+0000","id":"394462630661212_948180621956074"},{"message":"This video really sums up the Syrian refugee problem, to me.  \n     \n   ","updated_time":"2016-03-28T18:22:33+0000","id":"394462630661212_948010418639761"},{"message":"What happens to the world?!\n","updated_time":"2016-03-28T18:22:22+0000","id":"394462630661212_948010365306433"},{"message":"Does The United States Still Exist?

(p10):\n\nThe three governments should commit themselves to the long-term goal of dramatically diminishing the need for the current intensity of the governments\u2019 physical control of cross-border traffic, travel, and trade within North America. A long-term goal for a North American border action plan should be joint screening of travelers from third countries at their first point of entry into North America and the elimination of most controls over the temporary movement of these travelers within North America.\n ########################\n\nOpen skies and open roads (p25):\n\nThe efficiency of the transportation network is critical to making North America a more competitive place to invest and to produce, and in spreading the benefits of economic growth to all corners of the continent. Among other regulatory reforms, governments should consider the benefits of allowing North American transportation firms unlimited access to each others\u2019 territory, including provision for full cabotage (trade between two points within a country; for example, a Canadian trucker hauling freight from Chicago to Los Angeles or an American airline carrying passengers between Mexico City and Monterrey) for airlines and surface carriers.\n ########################\n\nExpand temporary migrant worker programs (p27):\n\nCanada and the United States should expand programs for temporary labor migration from Mexico. For instance, Canada\u2019s successful model for managing seasonal migration in the agricultural sector should be expanded to other sectors where Canadian producers face a shortage of workers and Mexico may have a surplus of workers with appropriate skills. Canadian and U.S. retirees living in Mexico should be granted working permits in certain fields, for instance as English teachers.\n ########################\n\nMove to full labor mobility between Canada and the United States (p27-28):\n\nTo make companies based in North America as competitive as possible in the global economy, Canada and the United States should consider eliminating all remaining barriers to the ability of their citizens to live and work in the other country. This free flow of people would offer an important advantage to employers in both countries by giving them rapid access to a larger pool of skilled labor, and would enhance the well-being of individuals in both countries by enabling them to move quickly to where their skills are needed. In the long term, the two countries should work to extend this policy to Mexico as well, though doing so will not be practical until wage differentials between Mexico and its two North American neighbors have diminished considerably.\n ########################\n\nA North American Advisory Council (p31):\n\nTo ensure a regular injection of creative energy into the various efforts related to North American integration, the three governments should appoint an independent body of advisers.

Its impressive hacking capabilities basically permit it access to any computer anywhere in the world despite the complaints we hear about companies like Apple.  It routinely entraps vulnerable people into fake terror plots, providing them with the means and logistics to do so, then arresting them for it.  It spies on us using the most sophisticated technology including Stingrays while demanding customer information from banks, phone and other companies under a provision of The Patriot Act.  Meanwhile, it tolerates a whole host of illegal activities from its range of criminal informants.\n\nWhitehead reminds us of the recent FBI advisory to teachers, inviting them and other students to snitch on fellow schoolmates looking for signs of domestic terrorism, as reported by The Liberty Beacon earlier.  The types of things taken as indicators of domestic terrorism could include the interests of many of us reading this online news site, including the NWO, constitutional liberties, 2nd amendment oriented views, fears of an economic collapse and survivalism.  Are we under especial surveillance?\n\nA monolithic agency, the FBI boasted a huge (minimum) budget of $8.3 billion in 2015 alone, a vast array of cutting edge technology, liaisons with many other government agencies, 35,000 employees working in 456 agencies around the US, and the largest biometric database in the world.  Much information is contained on people who haven\u2019t even yet committed any crime but may have come to the attention of the agency for apparently innocuous things.\n\nObserves Whitehead, \u2018[o]wing largely to the influence and power of the FBI, the United States\u2014once a nation that abided by the rule of law and held the government accountable for its actions\u2014has steadily devolved into a police state where justice is one-sided, a corporate elite runs the show, representative government is a mockery, police are extensions of the military, surveillance is rampant, privacy is extinct, and the law is little more than a tool for the government to browbeat the people into compliance.\u2019\n\nEnjoy Whitehead\u2019s incisive article. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.rutherford.org\/publications_resources\/john_whiteheads_commentary\/americas_gestapo_the_fbis_reign_of_terror","story":"Pam Barker shared The Liberty Beacon's photo to the group: Constitutional Patriots.","updated_time":"2016-03-23T17:15:54+0000","id":"394462630661212_942938499146953"},{"message":"Gun rights, religious liberties, private property rights, and personal freedoms will all be in grave jeopardy if the Senate schedules hearings and votes to confirm Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Mr. Garland would \u201cmake the justice at the center of the court more liberal than at any point in nearly 50 years\u201d.\n\nPlease join me in contacting our Senators and demand #NoHearingsNoVotes on Garland.\n\n","updated_time":"2016-03-23T14:09:09+0000","id":"394462630661212_942769692497167"},{"message":"Whether you would or would not vote for either Trump or Cruz, this is a post you must read and ponder (think hard and deeply) about.","updated_time":"2016-03-23T07:10:13+0000","id":"394462630661212_942492069191596"},{"message":"Yesterday Donald Trump met with the President of The Heritage Foundation, the most influential conservative Think Tank in Washington.\n\nIn a separate news conference yesterday Mr. Trump disclosed that he has asked The Heritage Foundation for a list of possible candidates for his review for SCOTUS justice, should he be elected President.\n\nBoth are clear indications that Mr. Trump is committed to conservative values and principles.\n\n","updated_time":"2016-03-23T03:17:05+0000","id":"394462630661212_942053769235426"},{"updated_time":"2016-03-23T02:11:14+0000","id":"394462630661212_942304359210367"},{"updated_time":"2016-03-22T23:41:22+0000","id":"394462630661212_942202089220594"},{"message":"Sad\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude2a\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude2a","updated_time":"2016-03-22T21:06:13+0000","id":"394462630661212_942096442564492"},{"message":"The Republican establishment\u2019s path to the Presidency has been closed and two lanes have opened in the primaries:\n1) Traditional Constitutional Lane for those eager to make life better for all Americans based on free enterprise, not crony capitalism, and based on healthy families, friendships, church groups, and other civic involvements that advance a free society\n2) Populist Lane for those fed up with a corrupt political system that caters to the well-connected at the expense of ordinary Americans.

This is an image of a sales receipt from Cabela's, a popular sporting goods store.The 2.3\u0025 Medical Excise Tax that began on January 1st is supposed to be \"hidden\" from the consumer,but it's been brought to the public's attention by hunting and fishing store Cabela's who have refused to hide it and are showing it as a separate line item tax on their receipts, the email states. I did some research and found directly from the IRS's website information that PROVES this to be true and an accurate portrayal of something hidden in \"Obamacare\" that I was not aware of! Now being skeptical of this I went to the IRS website and found this! Q1.\nWhat is the medical device excise tax? A1. Section 4191 of the Internal Revenue Code\nimposes an excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices by the manufacturer or importer of the device.\nQ2. When does the tax go into effect? A2. The tax applies to sales of taxable medical devices after Dec. 31, 2012.\nQ3. How much is the tax? A3. The tax is 2.3 percent of the sale price of the taxable medical device. See Chapter 5 of IRS Publication 510, Excise Taxes, and Notice 2012-77 for additional information on the determination of sale price.\nIRS.gov \nSo being more curious I clicked on \"Chapter 5 of IRS Publication 510.\" And what do I find under \"MEDICAL DEVICES\" under \"MANUFACTURERS TAXES\"? The following discussion of manufacturers taxes applies to the tax on: Guns and amo; Sport fishing equipment; Fishing rods and fishing poles; Electric outboard motors; Fishing tackle boxes; Bows, quivers, broadheads, and points; Arrow shafts; Coal; Taxable tires; Gas guzzler automobiles; and Vaccines. IRS.gov I think we have definitely been fooled, if we believe that the Affordable Care Act is all about health care. It truly does appear to be nothing more than a bill laden with a whole lot of taxes that we the people have yet to be aware of.\nPlease pass this on .

The Freedom of Information Act is supposed to deliver on the idea of a government \u201cfor and by the people,\u201d whose documents are our documents. The ability to get information from the government is essential to holding the people in power accountable.\u2019\n\nIndeed. When Obama came to power, as Justin Elliott of ProPublica reminds us, he promised the \u2018most transparent administration in history\u2019. But the very opposite has proved to be the case.\n\nElliott uses this piece to detail his own experience making a FOI request in February of 2014 to FEMA into the mishandling of the response to Hurricane Sandy. Although the Freedom of Information Act requires that a response be given within 20 business days, one never transpired and Elliott had to pursue his request again.\n\nThe response he got, in addition to replies received in many other cases he details in this article, suggests neglect and incompetence, or as veteran FOIA lawyer Simon Hodes remarks, \u2018it\u2019s not treated as an important thing within the administration\u2019.\n\nIn fact, in one case where a NBC4 Washington reporter requested files into the 2013 Navy Yard shooting, an e-mail sent in error revealed how Navy officials were actively working to block the request.\n\u2018The backlog of requests at FEMA has ballooned to 1,500. That\u2019s more than double what it was less than two years ago.\u2019\n\nEnjoy Elliott\u2019s article by clicking here: https:\/\/www.propublica.org\/\u2026\/trying-to-get-records-from-mos\u2026","story":"Pam Barker shared The Liberty Beacon's photo to the group: Constitutional Patriots.","updated_time":"2016-03-20T22:16:36+0000","id":"394462630661212_939317479509055"},{"message":"How Anonymous Just Fooled Donald Trump, the Secret Service, and the FBI...WAKE UP AMERICA...THIS MUST GO VIRAL...\n","updated_time":"2016-03-20T20:13:14+0000","id":"394462630661212_939268242847312"},{"message":"Disenchantment and mistrust of the political class has created a movement that extends beyond both political parties.\n\nThe dull, tired, re-tread nature and failed policies of the Democrat candidates for POTUS have left many Independents and Democrats disenchanted and looking elsewhere for leadership.\n\nThe betrayal of the electorate by GOP career politicians on key issues that swept them into power has resulted in the rejection of all GOP establishment candidates for President. \n\nA consensus is developing that neither group will allow career politicians to double down on the failed policies of their last seven years.\n\n","updated_time":"2016-03-20T18:57:46+0000","id":"394462630661212_938796062894530"},{"message":"A must listen to if you are concerned about our country.

He added that most of his supporters have \"never believed in the system,\" and warned again that \"bad things would happen\" if he lost the nod at the convention.\n","updated_time":"2016-03-17T18:42:40+0000","id":"394462630661212_935979506509519"},{"message":"Mr. cruz knew that texas had not done there obligation. texas refused to do it and cruz argued that the federal government cant make them or do anything about the fact that they did not do what they where obligated to do. i dont hate cruz but he is not a for the people person he pretends to be. if he was why did he pull every trick to stand against them. it was his job to fight for the state, it was his oath to fight for the people. he went for state over people. that is fact. this is a matter of healthcare. he didn't care about the health of the people. its not like this was just some stupid thing. so when he talks about fighting for the people, remember he did not do that as he was oathed to do.

If you think that there is *any* judgement seat for us believers over \"who is or isn't a *real* Christian\" for such trivialities, I have to say you do not understand LOGIC or fundamental Christian teaching. \n\nBy saying that you *know* Trump is \u201cnot really\u201d a Christian, you are saying you know his heart. You do not. God does, not you. \n\nTrump says he is a Christian and unless you have a much, much better argument than the few I have countered in this post and meme, I say that you need to get down on your knees and talk to God in prayer. \n\nWho are you to say that John Calvin was not a Christian? Who are you to say that everyone who believes that way is not Christian? \n\nWho are you to say that Trump can't say \"Two Corinthians\"?\n\nWho are you to say that because space was rented to a strip club, years after Trump only owned a 10\u0025 stake in that casino, that he is not \"saved\"?\n\nAnd don't give me this \"he's been divorced two times and his current wife did xyz\". Sorry, millions of Christians have been divorced\/remarried and are accepted in fellowship. Many who were guilty of extra-marital affairs. Including some clergy!\n\nMelania is not a \"whore\" or anything remotely close to that. She was a model in Europe, where regular non-model, women go topless on the beach. She never made a XXX movie and she certainly is not a \"prostitute\" for marrying a wealthy and older businessman. Unless Jackie Kennedy was also one when she married Aristotle Onassis.\n\nThe fact is EVEN IF she had been an actual prostitute, what does the bible say about that?\n\nPerhaps you should look up the story of Hosea and Gomer. \n\nTry also Tamar and Judah.\n\nWhat does the bible say about Rahab?\n\nThose were *real* incidences of *real* prostitution, not someone who posed for a photograph.\n\nI am ashamed of how much hate I have seen thrown on our possible future first lady, because she was a model in Europe and took some racy photos.\n\nGuess what? If Megyn Kelly was from Europe those spreads of her might have shown her baby feeding equipment also!\n\nFirst take the log out of your own eye before trying to take the speck out of the eye of anyone else.\n\n(BTW, Trump has publicly admitted that his past marital indiscretions, are fair game. He was asked this when he brought up Slick Willie after hillary accused him of being a sexist.  That means he ADMITS he did do some wrong. He has publicly confessed that, which is *exactly* what Christians are to do when we sin)\n\nSo why am I disgusted?\n\nBecause the people waging this attack on Trump are engaged in a form of BIGOTRY.\n\nReligious bigotry, particularly doctrinal bigotry.\n\nThe ironic thing is that who gets accused of being a bigot?\n\nTrump! \n\nTrump with his converted Jewish daughter and who says he loves Israel?\n\nWho wants to negotiate a Camp David Accord style peace deal as an honest, neutral broker to bring some peace to the Holy Land?\n\nThey twist his words to make it seem like he meant \"military neutrality\" so you go away thinking if Israel was being attacked a Trump administration would allow that. \n\nHe never said anything like that.\n\nHe says it repeatedly, \"I love Israel, I love the Jewish people\".\n\nSo people launch these extremely hateful bigoted attacks against the man and then some of the same ones turn around and call him a bigot because they took his words out of context on Israel.\n\nThe bible tells us to train up a child in the way to go and when they grow up they will in no wise depart from it.\n\nTrump was raised in the Presbyterian church. They don't believe exactly the same things many other people believe. For example on salvation (becoming \"saved\")\n\n*****\n\"What do Presbyterians mean when they speak of predestination?\"\n\n\"Calvin defines predestination as \"God's eternal decree, by which he compacted with himself what he willed to become of each [person]. \n\nFor ... eternal life is foreordained for some, eternal damnation for others.\n\nSo predestination is an act of God's will through which God elects or chooses those whom God calls to faith and thus to eternal life, and through which God chooses those who will not receive faith.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.presbyterianmission.org\/ministries\/today\/predestination\/\n*****\n\nI am no Calvinist, but why would someone need to seek salvation if they believe that?\n\nWhat about confession, do they go to confession like Catholics do? Not according to this. They believe in the \"confessions of faith\":\n\n*****\n\n\"Every Sunday, in many of our Presbyterian congregations, we reaffirm our faith using all or part of one of our confessions--often the Apostles' Creed or the Nicene Creed, or A Brief Statement of Faith. \n\nThe first part of the constitution of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) is the Book of Confessions, which contains 11 formal statements of faith structured as creeds, confessions and catechisms. \n\nElders throughout the denomination, training for leadership, study each of the confessions, its historical origins, and its theological emphases.
