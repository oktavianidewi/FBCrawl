And, from pyramids to nightclubs, you'll find \n\nthere is much to enjoy away from the water too.\n\nHere's our top windsurfing locations in Egypt:\n\nDahab\n\nOnce the preserve of backpackers and hippies, Dahab has begun to change and now combines its famed laid-back vibe with some upscale \n\nresort hotels and a thriving watersports scene. Its shallow, sheltered lagoon is fantastic for beginners who want to try out \n\nwindsurfing safely. Intermediates can venture further out into the bay for safe, flat waters with faster winds, while the advanced \n\ncan test their skills on the open sea, where waves swell up to 3m.\n\nHurghada\n\nHurghada is one of the biggest of the Red Sea resorts with plenty of top-quality hotels right on the beach. It attracts a mix of \n\nsunbathers, scuba divers, kitesurfers and windsurfers. It's a particularly good resort for beginners, with a large lagoon offering \n\nan easy introduction to the sport. It boats several kilometres of coast for advanced surfers to explore. Winds are strongest in the \n\nsummer months, reaching up to 25 knots.\n- See more at: http:\/\/www.exploco.com\/blog\/18748\/top-ten-windsurfing-locations-in-egypt\/#sthash.TBCDbMT2.dpuf\n\nDahab\n\nOnce the preserve of backpackers and hippies, Dahab has begun to change and now combines its famed laid-back vibe with some upscale \n\nresort hotels and a thriving watersports scene. Its shallow, sheltered lagoon is fantastic for beginners who want to try out \n\nwindsurfing safely. Intermediates can venture further out into the bay for safe, flat waters with faster winds, while the advanced \n\ncan test their skills on the open sea, where waves swell up to 3m.\n\nSafaga\n\nSafaga has a large beach and plenty of space in its flat-water lagoon for beginners to get acquainted with their sails. It is \n\nprobably one of the best resorts in Egypt for new surfers, with reliable but gentle winds and no worries about having to share \n\nlagoon space with swimmers and kitesurfers.\n\nIntermediate and advanced surfers will find some good slalom and freestyle conditions, and can find some swell outside the bay. \n\nSafaga is a good choice for mixed-ability groups. It's a small resort with only a handful of hotels and a traditional Egyptian town \n\naway from the beach.\n\nSoma Bay\n\nThis is a fairly new resort, which provides great conditions for windsurfers of all levels. The setting is stunning, with nothing to \n\nsee but azure sea and white sand. There are two bays separated by a sand spit, both with the flat water that beginners and \n\nfreestylers love. The more advanced can head out of the bay to find some decent sized waves.\n\nEl Gouna\n\nA unique, purpose-built resort made up of a series of interlinked islands, it's a permanent home for an international community of \n\n10,000. It is one of Egypt's most attractive and unusual holiday destinations, a self-sufficient town that aims to be as \n\nenvironmentally friendly as possible.\n\nEl Gouna makes a wonderful getaway, and a wonderful place to windsurf too. There is a reliable cross-shore wind which should keep \n\nthe more advanced happy, and a nice shallow lagoon area for beginners to get their sea legs. There is a good, but not raucous, \n\nnightlife with plenty of bars and restaurants, and just about any other activity you can imagine available either in the town or \n\nclose by.\n\nMore information:\nhttp:\/\/sport.gis-travel.com\/index.php\/en\/windsurfing.html","updated_time":"2016-04-15T14:31:33+0000","id":"2363953408_10153756946458409"},{"message":"Around Dubai With An 18-Month Old Toddler #travel #ttot #blogger #Indian","updated_time":"2016-04-15T14:29:29+0000","id":"2363953408_10153756944108409"},{"story":"Lucia Quevedo shared Turismerk L'alianxa's photo to the group: TRAVEL ADDICTION.","updated_time":"2016-04-15T14:26:23+0000","id":"2363953408_10153756940273409"},{"message":"VILLA GLYFOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
