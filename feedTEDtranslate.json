Check out this awesome message TED speaker Siyanda Mohutsiwa requested to be passed along to our wonderful OTP tribe. :) Let's help Siyanda get her talk translated into many languages, in particular French, Portuguese, Arabic, and Swahili, which are spoken by many people in Africa.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy talk was supposed to be about a hashtag, but somehow it became a talk about hope! When I gave this speech in Amsterdam, at the end of it, an older African man came to find me, and he had tears in his eyes\u2014a man the age of my father! He told me he had once been a refugee, moving from Congo to the Netherlands. He told me that my talk had reignited in him a love of Africa and had softened the anger he had towards men like Kabila and Mobutu who had all but destroyed life for ordinary people in his region. To me this was most moving. \n\nWhen the talk went up on TED after I gave it in Vancouver for a larger audience, I got emails from all over Africa expressing the same feeling: hope. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014not that many people will see it. The vast majority of Africans have no access to this stuff. But I believe in my heart, whoever I can reach with my message\u2014the message of some kid in Botswana who just wants to share the message of a hopeful tomorrow to a continent filled with those who see no reason to believe, I might reach someone. I might reach future leaders who just might see this speech and carry in their hearts this compassion\u2014a compassion that we desperately need and which we unknowingly have in all our cultures (all over the world!) and maybe, these leaders of tomorrow, will make a change that we so desperately need.\n\nBut the other thing is: not everyone speaks English in Africa. And although I have real plans to learn French and Swahili and Portuguese and one day Arabic, I have full faith in you all to help me spread my message with the elegance with which you have done others, as soon as you can. I would deeply appreciate that, and I know one day, so will the Francophones and Luophones and babui ba Swahili and the Arabians who make up this great big continent I call home.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","updated_time":"2016-04-01T19:18:02+0000","id":"43410681471_10153413411076472"},{"message":"Hi everyone,\n\nHave you watched Angelica Dass\u2019 TEDTalk, The beauty of human skin in every color?

Nu ma refer in mod special la idioms. Va dau un exemplu de un idiom: \" Ball is in your court\" care cuvant cu cuvant tradus inseamna: mingea e in curtea ta. Bineintels ca fiecare stie ce inseamna in idiom si nimeni nu va traduce fraza aceasta folosind cuvandul \"mingea\" sau \"curte\". Autorul nu a descris un joc cu mingea in curte. De aceea e necesar sa nu traduceti cuvant cu cuvant, ci sa adaptati traducerea si traducereea corecta este: \"E randul tau acum sa hotarasti ce vrei sa faci\" sau: depinde de tine. Insa, sunt cazuri cand aveti de traduc o fraza care nu e un idiom, insa fraza care va da de furca, trebuie tratata ca un idiom si adaptata la limba romana. Cateva sfaturi: evitati infinitivul. Nu suna natural, si ia si mult spatiu. Il puteti inlocui cu conjuctiv. De asemena, nu lasati prepozitii la capat de rand. E foarte important sa cititi cu voce tare ce ati traus si daca suna fortat sau pretentios, aveti libertatea sa inlocuiti si sa adaptati textul, atata timp cat pastrati idea autorului, si nu deviati de la subiect. Daca aveti cea mai mica banuiala ca autotul foloseste un idiom sau nu sunteti siguri, folositi google si aflati daca fraza respectiva e in lista de idioms sau cereti ajutor, aici.

I take great care in syncing the subtitle exactly at the start of the speech, in my view it enhances the overall experience of watching the video.\nNow, I've noticed that with TEDx talks, playing on Youtube, the sync is exactly as in the Amara editor. With TEDTalks though, playing in the proprietary TED environment, the sync seems to get shifted forward by what looks to be about 0.3 seconds, it's clearly noticeable. So, instead of the sharp cut audio-visual as it was created in the Amara editor, you get this weird feeling of precognition on the TED platform after publishing. Anything I can do about this?","updated_time":"2015-12-14T15:15:04+0000","id":"43410681471_10153129303086472"},{"message":"Hello, \n\nI've finished translating the TEDx Talk: \"A ilus\u00e3o da apar\u00eancia\" | Sara Ortins | TEDxFCTUNL from Portuguese to English. In this TEDx Talk, Sara, who has a precarious health condition, warns us for the fact that a normal, healthy appearance, can deceive our look and hide serious health problems that aren't revealed to strangers, by feelings of shame from who have them. It's a lesson of life and a wake up call for a more sensitive, compassionate and emphatic attitude from us to the Other apparently equal. \n\nSo, because I think it's a TedTalk worth sharing, I'm contacting you to know if someone is willing to review my translation.","updated_time":"2015-12-13T10:39:20+0000","id":"43410681471_10153187150981472"},{"updated_time":"2015-12-13T10:39:09+0000","id":"43410681471_10153122066131472"},{"message":"Dear TED translators,\n\nHi!

(Edited: added the following) The user hasn't done anything intentionally to enter x08 in Amara editor, but somehow the character gets entered and will cause \"Error saving subtitles\" error. If some of you could think of several ways such as key sequence or certain operations on editor, I would ask the user to look for that operation.","updated_time":"2015-07-15T14:37:40+0000","id":"43410681471_10152934381061472"},{"message":"Hello, I've recently translated this TEDxTalk from Lauryn Ballesteros (about bold authenticity in speaking your \u201ctrueself\u201d) and a Found in Translation Panel that may be useful for somebody willing to know how translating TEDTalks works and the amazing community that comes with it. \n\nSomebody available to review them?\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qIrTYnuHYu4\n\nMany thanks you in advance... :)","updated_time":"2015-07-14T14:21:06+0000","id":"43410681471_10152933590801472"},{"message":"Hey, I'm new to this and I can't figure out how to split the subtitles.

I am TED's Russian translator. I mostly do the Ted-ed videos (you can see my translations of The Use of Metaphor, Why Shakespeare Wrote in Iambic Pentameter, What is an Earworm? and some others). I really like Ted-Eds. The issue might not be new, but we have been discussing it in our Russian FB-group and we have decided to bring it on international board. We want the names of translators be visible. We think it's quite natural to sign what has been done by you. Why not allow us to sign our works by writing TRANSLATED (into Russian) BY after the text of the scripts as the \"last (additional) capture\" or in the description after the author's name and the animation by info? We could put Author, Animation, Translation. Maybe also Edited by? If it's not a new issue, so give me some feedback on that since I am relatively new to TED.com (I started this year).

In the editor, each subtitle now has an option menu, which can be accessed by hovering over the wrench icon. (see image)\n\nMenu options include: seeking the video to the point where the subtitle plays, inserting a subtitle above \/ below the active subtitle, deleting the subtitle, and adding a time-coded note associated with the subtitle.\n\n2. New keyboard shortcuts (see image)\n\n3. SHIFT + SPACE no longer triggers the video to play or pause\n\n4. Subtitles with invalid timestamps won\u2019t be allowed (i.e. two subtitles which start and end at the same time)\n\n5. When comparing two revisions, red text indicates the text has changed.
